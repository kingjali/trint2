# File Upload Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL script to create the file storage table:
```sql
-- Run mysql_file_table.sql in your MySQL database
```

### 2. Directory Setup
Create the upload directory structure:
```bash
mkdir -p uploads/jobs
chmod 755 uploads/jobs
```

### 3. File Replacement
Replace your existing `new_import_job.php` with `enhanced_new_import_job.php`

### 4. File Management
Place the file management files in a `file_manager` directory:
- `view_job_files.php` - View uploaded files for a job
- `download_file.php` - Secure file download handler

```

## Troubleshooting
